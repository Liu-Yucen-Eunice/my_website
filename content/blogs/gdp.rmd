#GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xlsx"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.


```{r}
#change the dataframe to long format, and express all figures in billions
tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
  
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51, names_to = 'year', values_to = 'value') %>% 

  mutate(value=value/1e9)

#shorten the name of the indicators

tidy_GDP_data[tidy_GDP_data == "Exports of goods and services"] <- "Exports"
tidy_GDP_data[tidy_GDP_data == "Imports of goods and services"] <- "Imports"
tidy_GDP_data[tidy_GDP_data == "General government final consumption expenditure"] <- "Government expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data[tidy_GDP_data == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)"] <- "Household expenditure"

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
GDP_components_list <- c("Gross capital formation","Exports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Imports")

#filter to the 3 countries and 5 indicators that we want to plot
tidy_GDP_data_1 <-tidy_GDP_data%>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% 
  filter(IndicatorName %in% GDP_components_list)
```


```{r}
#change column name IndicatorName to Components of GDP
colnames(tidy_GDP_data_1)[3]<-"Components of GDP"

```



```{r}
#plot the graph
tidy_GDP_data_1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=value, group = `Components of GDP`, colour =`Components of GDP` ))+
  geom_line(size=0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010))+
  labs(title = 'GDP Components over time', subtitle = 'In constant 2010 GDP', y = 'Billion US$',x=NULL) +
  theme_bw() + theme(text = element_text(size=10), aspect.ratio = 2)
```



```{r}
# Let us compare GDP components for China, Japan and Korea

```{r}
my_country_list <- c("China","Japan", "Republic of Korea")
GDP_components_list <- c("Gross capital formation","Exports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Imports")
