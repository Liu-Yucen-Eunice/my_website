# About Myself

I am **Eunice Liu** from [Jiangxi Province, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi). I am a MFA student at LBS. I studied in Hong Kong for my high school and undergraduate degree. I majored in quantitative finance at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I can speak Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. 


My hobbies are:

- Biking

knitr:: include_graphics("/img/hike.jpg", error = FALSE)
```

- Music
- Singing
- Cats

```{r image 1, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr:: include_graphics("/img/cat.jpg", error = FALSE)
```

My favorite cartoon character is Duffy Family.
