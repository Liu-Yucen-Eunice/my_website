# Challenge 2: GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xlsx"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.


```{r}
#change the dataframe to long format, and express all figures in billions
tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
  
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51, names_to = 'year', values_to = 'value') %>% 

  mutate(value=value/1e9)

#shorten the name of the indicators

tidy_GDP_data[tidy_GDP_data == "Exports of goods and services"] <- "Exports"
tidy_GDP_data[tidy_GDP_data == "Imports of goods and services"] <- "Imports"
tidy_GDP_data[tidy_GDP_data == "General government final consumption expenditure"] <- "Government expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data[tidy_GDP_data == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)"] <- "Household expenditure"

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
GDP_components_list <- c("Gross capital formation","Exports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Imports")

#filter to the 3 countries and 5 indicators that we want to plot
tidy_GDP_data_1 <-tidy_GDP_data%>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% 
  filter(IndicatorName %in% GDP_components_list)
```


```{r}
#change column name IndicatorName to Components of GDP
colnames(tidy_GDP_data_1)[3]<-"Components of GDP"

```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```



```{r}
#plot the graph
tidy_GDP_data_1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=value, group = `Components of GDP`, colour =`Components of GDP` ))+
  geom_line(size=0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010))+
  labs(title = 'GDP Components over time', subtitle = 'In constant 2010 GDP', y = 'Billion US$',x=NULL) +
  theme_bw() + theme(text = element_text(size=10), aspect.ratio = 2)
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.


```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#change the dataframe to wide format and calculate net exports and proportion of GDP
tidy_GDP_data_2 <- tidy_GDP_data_1 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = `Components of GDP`,values_from=value) %>% 
  mutate(`Net Exports` = Exports-Imports) %>% 
  mutate(`Gross GDP Calculated` = `Government expenditure`+`Gross capital formation`+`Household expenditure`+`Net Exports`) %>% 
  mutate(`Government Expenditure proportion` = `Government expenditure`/`Gross GDP Calculated`) %>% 
  mutate(`Gross capital formation proportion` = `Gross capital formation`/`Gross GDP Calculated`) %>% 
  mutate(`Household Expenditure proportion` = `Household expenditure`/`Gross GDP Calculated`) %>% 
  mutate(`Net exports proportion` = `Net Exports`/`Gross GDP Calculated`)

#change the dataframe to long format again and shows the proportion
tidy_GDP_data_3 <- tidy_GDP_data_2 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 11:14, names_to = 'Components', values_to ="Percentage" )

#plot the second graph
tidy_GDP_data_3 %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=year, y=Percentage, group = Components, colour = Components))+
    geom_line(size=0.8) +
    facet_wrap(~Country) +
    scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010))+
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy=0.1)) +
    labs(title = 'GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars', y = 'porportion',x=NULL, caption = "Source:United Nations, https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads") +
    theme_bw() + theme(text = element_text(size=10), aspect.ratio = 2)+
    theme(legend.title = element_blank())

```
> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r}
#Create the dataframe showing the GDP in the source table

country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
GDP_list <- c("Gross capital formation","Exports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Imports","Gross Domestic Product (GDP)")

tidy_GDP_data_4 <-tidy_GDP_data%>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% 
  filter(IndicatorName %in% GDP_list)

#Calculate the GDP manually from components and then calculate the percetnage difference between the calucalted GDP and GDP shown in the orginial source

tidy_GDP_data_5 <- tidy_GDP_data_4 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = `IndicatorName`,values_from=value) %>% 
  mutate(`Gross GDP Calculated` = `Government expenditure`+`Gross capital formation`+`Household expenditure`+`Exports`-`Imports`) %>% 
  mutate(percent_diff = 
           (`Gross GDP Calculated`- `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)`)/`Gross Domestic Product (GDP)`)       

tidy_GDP_data_5[c(2,3,9,10,11)]


#The percentage difference is shown as percent_diff. For example, the percentage differnce for Germany is 1970 is 3.03%.
  
```

```

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

#The last chart shows that household expenidture accounts for most of the GDP in all three countries. The net exports take the least proportion in GDP among three countries. 

In India, the consumption proportion is decreasing over the decades while the investment proportion is increasing. It shows that investment opportunities in India have increased a lot over 2000-2010. 

The Germany has increasing proportion of net exports in 2000s, which shows Germany has become a more active exporter in the world market. The U.S. has decreasing government expenditure percentage, which maybe show that U.S. government is not spending as much as before.

#It shows that China has increasing % of net exports and investment expenditure.

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
