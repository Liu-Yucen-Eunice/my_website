# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  
  # Selecting columns from 1-13
  select(1:13) %>% 
  
  #Condensing months to one variable 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, names_to = 'month', values_to = 'delta')

tidyweather
```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )
```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

> Yes - the effect of increasing temperature is higher in the Winter quarter, which is November to February. This can be due to the high energy consumptions for heating purposes during winters. 

```{r}

#Your code goes here...

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~factor(month, labels = month.name[1:12], ordered = TRUE)) +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm = TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}

formula_ci <- comparison %>%  
  # Filtering data to 2011-present
  filter(interval == '2011-present') %>% 
  group_by(interval) %>% 
  # Calculating summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  summarise(mean = mean(delta, na.rm = TRUE), 
            std = sd(delta, na.rm =TRUE),
            count = n(),
            SE = std / sqrt(count),
  # t-critical value with 95% CI
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * SE,
            rating_low = mean - margin_of_error,
            rating_high = mean + margin_of_error)
  

formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
set.seed(122)
boot_delta <- comparison %>%
  # Filtering data to 2011-present
  filter(interval == '2011-present') %>%
  
  specify(response = delta) %>%
  
  generate(reps = 1000, type = 'bootstrap') %>%
 
  calculate(stat = 'mean')

percentile_ci <- boot_delta %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = 'percentile')

percentile_ci
```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

> We have constructed 2 95% CIs using bootstrapping and manual construction for our data filtered to the 2011-present. For manual construction, we calcualted the summary statisitics and used the t-distrbution method to create CI. For bootstrapping, we declared the variable in question and used mean to create a CI. The 95% CIs constrcuted from bootstrapping and manual construction offer a  similar interval, yet margially different. With manual constrcution, we can be assured that 95% of the time the mean would fall within these intervals whereas with bootstrapping, the statistics and repeated sampling of a sample show the distribution of the data . 



# Global warming and political views (GSS)

[A 2010 Pew Research poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/2010/10/27/wide-partisan-divide-over-global-warming/) asked 1,306 Americans, "From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?"


In this exercise we analyze whether there are any differences between the proportion of people who believe the earth is getting warmer and their political ideology. As usual, from the **survey sample data**, we will use the proportions to estimate values of *population parameters*. The file has 2253 observations on the following 2 variables:

- `party_or_ideology`: a factor (categorical) variable with levels Conservative Republican, Liberal Democrat, Mod/Cons Democrat, Mod/Lib Republican
- `response` : whether the respondent believes the earth is warming or not, or Don't know/ refuse to answer

```{r, read_global_warming_pew_data}
global_warming_pew <- read_csv(here::here("data", "global_warming_pew.csv"))
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".


```{r}
global_warming_pew %>% 
  count(party_or_ideology, response)
```

We will be constructing three 95% confidence intervals to estimate population parameters, for the % who believe that **Earth is warming**, accoridng to their party or ideology. You can create the CIs using the formulas by hand, or use `prop.test()`-- just rememebr to exclude the Dont know / refuse to answer!

```{r}

global_warming_new <- global_warming_pew %>% 
  filter(response != 'Don\'t know / refuse to answer') %>% 
   # Merging Moderates to get 3 CIs
  mutate(party_or_ideology = case_when(               
    grepl('Mod', party_or_ideology, TRUE) ~ 'Moderate',
    TRUE ~ party_or_ideology
  ))

gw_ci <- global_warming_new %>% 
  group_by(party_or_ideology) %>% 
  summarise(count_total = n(),
            success = count(response == 'Earth is warming'),
            lower_ci = prop.test(success, count_total)$conf.int[1],
            upper_ci = prop.test(success, count_total)$conf.int[2])
# show the confidence interval
gw_ci[c(1,4,5)]

```

```{r}
#To check effect of political lean on climate belief
gw_ci %>% 
  mutate(order = c(1:n())) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_linerange(aes(x = order, ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci, color = party_or_ideology), size = 2 ) +
  coord_flip()+
  scale_colour_wsj() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = 'CI of climate beliefs from different parties',
       y = 'confidence interval',
       x = 'party or ideology')

```

Does it appear that whether or not a respondent believes the earth is warming is independent of their party ideology? 

> The above analysis clearly shows that climate beleifs is impacted by party idealogy and hence dependent.

# Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist<- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate),
         startdate = mdy(startdate),
         enddate = mdy(enddate))
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
approval_new <- approval_polllist %>%
  
  # Filtering subgroup
  filter(subgroup == 'All polls') %>% 
  
  # Selecting relevant columns
  select(enddate, approve, disapprove) %>% 
  
  # Adding new variables to get week number from the date and net approval
  mutate(end_week = week(enddate), net_margin = approve - disapprove) %>% 
  
  group_by(end_week) %>% 
  
  # Calculating summary statistics
  summarise(mean_net_margin = mean(net_margin), 
            std = sd(net_margin),
            count = n(),
            SE = std / sqrt(count),
  # t-critical value with 95% CI
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * SE,
            ci_margin_low = mean_net_margin - margin_of_error,
            ci_margin_high = mean_net_margin + margin_of_error)

  
approval_new %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = end_week, y = mean_net_margin))+
  geom_line(aes(color = 'orange')) +
  geom_line(aes(x = end_week, y = ci_margin_low, color = 'orange')) +
  geom_line(aes(x = end_week, y = ci_margin_high, color = 'orange')) +
  geom_point(size = 2, color = 'orange') +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size = 2, color = 'orange') +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess', se = FALSE) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = ci_margin_low, ymax = ci_margin_high), fill = 'grey', alpha = 0.2) +
  ggtitle('Year 2021') +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(13,26)) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  labs(title = 'Estimating Approval Margin (approve-disapprove) for Joe Biden',
       subtitle = 'Weekly average of all polls',
       x = 'Week of year',
       y = 'Average Approval Margin (Approve - Disapprove)'
  )


```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 3` and `week 25`. Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

> The size of the CIs for week 3 and week 25 are different. Week 3 has lesser data entries as in polls and and week 29 has much more opinion polls. Therefore, the standard error changes and that impacts the size of the CI.
